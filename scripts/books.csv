The Catcher in the Rye,J.D. Salinger,3,1951,234,Literary Fiction,
The Vanishing Half,Brit Bennett,4,2020,343,Historical Fiction,"Great insight into race, identity, and gender disparities of past. Really challenged what I knew about choices and prejudice."
Before the Coffee Gets Cold,Toshikazu Kawaguchi,1,2015,227,Other,Oh my god??? Thought this was going to be a sweet and easy read. Suppose I should be careful what I wish for because why was it so slow and simple? Could genuinely only get through 50 pages before I was incredibly bored. Story is predictable and tries to be emotionally compelling/cute but it’s just lacks depth I fear.
Carrie Soto is Back,Taylor Jenkins Reid,5,2022,384,Contemporary Fiction,"Another Taylor Jenkins Reid bangerrr! Morally grey characters, a sweet love story, a vulnerable look at meaning and success, and beautiful family dynamics. Carrie Soto seemed to be everything I would dislike: vanity, brutalness, and ego. But Reid does an incredible job of weaving her story and building her personality brick by brick, so much so that you can easily empathize with her. Well-written, to the point, yet fluid writing once again! Solid book to start my summer reading journey of 2025."
Daisy Jones and the Six,Taylor Jenkins Reid,5,2019,368,Historical Fiction,Honestly expected better given the hype+author but still interesting style; really liked the voices/POVs.
Men Without Women,Haruki Murakami,3,2014,228,Literary Fiction,"Got through like 2.5 out of the 6 short stories in this series about men who find themselves alone. I like Haruki Murakami’s writing style; it’s clear and poignant when it needs to be. But after he started bringing up strange s*xual relations into his stories, I got turned off to be so honest. Liked the commentary about loneliness but also feel strange about reading about women from this man."
Cress,Marissa Meyer,4,2014,592,Science Fiction,
Boy in the Twilight,Yu Hua,3,2014,240,Literary Fiction,"A collection of short stories about small town life in China. Somehow mundane yet absurd. Really liked his voice, used simple sentences and diction but crafted landscapes that gave you just enough room for imagination. Lessons are very subtle and focus mainly on relationships, grit, and the everyday. At times satirically funny, at times devastating — always interesting!"
Homegoing,Yaa Gyasi,5,2016,305,Historical Fiction,
We Were Liars,E. Lockhart,3,2014,242,Contemporary Fiction,
Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?,Philip K. Dick,4,1968,210,Science Fiction,
The Refugees,Viet Thanh Ngyuen,5,2017,209,Literary Fiction,"Similar collection of short stories about loss, transition, relationships, and recovery following various Vietnamese refugees, torn in the aftermath and between two worlds. Nguyen does an incredible job of truly showing, not telling. Characters, narrators, and situations are illuminated subtly and incrementally, with an air of fantasy and lots of cultural imagery permeating each story. Nguyen embeds metaphors and symbolism so seamlessly in ways that only multiple reads make clear. Still, stories felt so so grounded, especially in the Asian American experience and I really enjoyed it."
